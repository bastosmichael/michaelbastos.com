title: Book Review - Twitter Power
---

I’d been looking for a good social media book that just focused on using Twitter as a platform, as more of my friends convinced me to use platforms like TweetDeck to simplify my social media footprint I picked up Twitter Power 2.0 after hearing much about the writer. All in all it’s a great book for beginners, it covers the basic concepts of twitter pretty well and teaches you the do’s and don’ts of the platform. It also gives you some pretty easy to understand tools and how best to use them so over all a great book for those looking to get more from their relationships on Twitter.
