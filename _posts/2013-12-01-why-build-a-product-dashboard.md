title: Why Build a Product Dashboard?
---

Before we started building our Ecommerce Dashboard we decided to do some Customer Validation to see if there is a need for being able to follow any product, anywhere, anytime with daily real time updates. You can read more about <a href="/what-we-do">what we do</a> and get a better perspective of our business and industry.

We are creating a system to change the way people research product pricing by designing an analyst independent, fully automated and accurate product market place where researchers can follow in real time any product for any business in the world in potentially any market.

#### Customer Validation
We decided to do some customer validation over a weekend, we sent the below survey out to over 658 people across many industries that could value and use this kind of tool. The responses we received on just a single day showed the business need and how important this kind of tool is to some people that they would go out of their way to give us these answers on a Saturday. First we asked them what kind of information they are looking for.

It was clear that the top 3 things most people needed for their market research is Purchase and Original Price along with product descriptions. Reviews came in fourth followed by Shipping. Then we asked them where they get their data?

It is obvious from the answers provided from this question that people are willing to take the time and collect this information themselves. There is a market here if we can remove the need for them to do the research themselves and make it more cost effective in the long run. Then we asked them about how they get their trends?

This question may not have told us much in the way of what potential customers already get, but it did tell us that a larger majority either doesn't receive it or don't understand the product well enough to do competitive analysis, a potential market to teach on the benefits of market intelligence. Then we asked him if they are happy with the speed with which they get their data?

This is overwhelming evidence that a daily data feed sent directly to people would be a winner at least in the small group segment surveyed. We would need to extend our existing pool but for now it’s glaringly obvious that no one does it fast enough. Then we asked them about the speed of their information?

For most of the individuals on the list this information is sparse and scarce to say the least, the fact that most of them don’t know how up to date their data is actually shows a lack of clarity in the pricing intelligence market that is needed. Then we asked how valuable this kind of data is to them?

Another obvious one from the onset, as Google likes to say in their 10 Things We Know to be True, Faster is better. The value people placed in this data is what we were looking for, then we asked them if there is a market there that they would pay for?

This question shows us that the need not just for a faster solution, but a cheaper one, remove most of the humans from the equation and what you’re left with is simply the cost of automation and hardware processing in the background. Then we asked them about the satisfaction of the data they are collecting or receiving?

Most of this industry works with Excel or older more arcane methods of data parsing and analyzing so this doesn't really tell us any more than we already knew, the fact that only a small segment is satisfied tells us how non standard the existing systems must be. Then we wanted to know about how many products they follow or would like to follow regularly?

It’s interesting to see that the number of products a product or research analyst may need to follow or keep track of is actually relatively small compared to the amount of data you would need to pull in order to pull this off, that’s where our secret sauce comes in.

On the same day this survey was sent, we also received a total of 6 email addresses asking to sign up for the service as soon as it’s available, this was way more real and available customers than we had anticipated and shows us the hunger for this even more. We hope to tell you more about our API coming in 2014 and Dashboard service as we slowly roll it out in 2015, for now we leave you with our data which we consider Pricels (Price-Less).
