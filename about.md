### What Are We Building?
We are creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service" target="_blank">price tracking platform</a> to change and disrupt the billion dollar product research industry for both enterprise and small companies to either use our tools or build their own on top of our <a href="http://developers.pricels.com" target="_blank">API</a>.
